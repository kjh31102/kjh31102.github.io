<p>Propyne is a convenient three-carbon building block for organic synthesis.
<br> Deprotonation with n-butyllithium gives propynyllithium.
This nucleophilic reagent adds to carbonyl groups,
<br> producing alcohols and esters.[6] Whereas purified propyne is expensive,
MAPP gas could be used to cheaply generate large amounts of the reagent.[7]
Propyne, along with 2-butyne, is also used to synthesize alkylated hydroquinones
in the total synthesis of vitamin E.[8]</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">The chemical shift of an alkynyl proton and propargylic proton generally
   occur in the same region of the 1H NMR spectrum.</p> In propyne,
   these two signals have almost exactly the same chemical shifts, <br><br><br>
   leading to overlap of the signals, and the 1H NMR spectrum of propyne, when
   recorded in deuteriochloroform on a 300 MHz instrument, consists of a single
   signal, a sharp singlet resonating at 1.8 ppm.[9]
